This project's goal is to work as a group studying and reconstructing the
[**loruki-website** tutorial](https://github.com/bradtraversy/loruki-website)
from Traversy Media. Your group is not expected to submit exactly the same code
as Mr. Traversy. You are free to add features, remove features, or write your
features differently than he did.

Copy-paste this checklist into a new _deliverables_ issue and move your issue to
the project board, your issue should have:

- labels:`group`, `deliverable` and `week-1`
- milestone: Agile Development

```Markdown
- [ ] [repo](https://github.com/_/_) (with a complete README)
- [ ] [live demo](https://_.github.io/_) (GitHub Pages, not Netlify)
- [/planning](https://github.com/_/_/tree/master/planning)
  - [ ] constraints
  - [ ] communication plan
  - [ ] user personas
  - [ ] backlog
  - [ ] design
  - [ ] development strategy
  - [ ] retrospective
- [ ] [project board](https://github.com/_/_/projects/1)
```

> PS. In the tutorial, Mr. Traversy deployes his website using Netlify. Your
> group should use GitHub Pages instead.
